            <p>Bangladesh sofficially known as the People's Republic of Bangladesh is an independent nation located in South Asia. It makes up the eastern and largest portion of the ethno-linguistic region of Bengal. It is situated at the zenith of the Bay of Bengal and is bordered by Myanmar and india and separated from vutan and nepal by the thin Siliguri Corridor.Present-day Bangladesh came out as a sovereign country in 1971 after breaking away and gaining independence from pakistan in the Bangladesh liberation war. Its early history was characterized by internal fighting, a succession of Indian empires, and a scuffle between Buddhism and Hinduism for dominance. The borders of modern Bangladesh were formed after the partition of India and Bengal in August 1947, when the area became East Pakistan as a section of the newly established State of Pakistan following the Radcliff Line. The name Bangladesh was initially written as two words, Bangla Desh. Bangla is a key word for both the Bengali language and the Bengal region. The exact origin of the term is, however, not known.
